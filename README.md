# Weather App

The brief was to create a weather app by fetching an API. 

During this week we'll start working with API's to fetch external data to our websites. We got the knowledge of how to use external data and public API's.

I learned:
– What an API is and how to use it
– Basic JSON
– How to use fetch() in JavaScript
– How to use promises in JavaScript

## The problem

I made it as simple as possible, like the site "vecka.nu". But if I had more time/knowledge I would have changed icon depending on weather. I still find it difficult to grasp Javascript.
